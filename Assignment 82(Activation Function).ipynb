    "1. Function Definition: The tanh function is a rescaled version of the sigmoid function. It maps the input to a value between -1 and 1. \n",
    "                        Mathematically, it is defined as f(x) = (exp(x) - exp(-x)) / (exp(x) + exp(-x)). Like the sigmoid function, the \n",
    "                        tanh function is also sigmoidal, but it has a range from -1 to 1 instead of 0 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Range and Symmetry: Unlike the sigmoid function, which ranges from 0 to 1, the tanh function ranges from -1 to 1. It is symmetric around \n",
    "                       the origin, with an output of 0 when the input is 0. The symmetry and broader output range of tanh make it suitable \n",
    "                       for tasks where inputs can have negative values or need to model both positive and negative patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Stronger Non-linearity: The tanh function provides stronger non-linearity than the sigmoid function. It maps a wider range of inputs to \n",
    "                           higher positive or negative outputs. This increased non-linearity allows neural networks to capture more complex \n",
    "                           relationships and model a broader range of patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Gradient Behavior: The derivative of the tanh function is steeper than that of the sigmoid function, which means the gradients are \n",
    "                      larger. This property can lead to faster learning during backpropagation and potentially better convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Zero-Centered Output: One advantage of the tanh function over the sigmoid function is that it produces a zero-centered output. When the \n",
    "                         input is centered around zero, the positive and negative activations can cancel each other out, helping in \n",
    "                         optimization and weight updates during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, similar to the sigmoid function, the tanh function can still suffer from the vanishing gradient problem for deep networks. \n",
    "For very large or small inputs, the gradients can become extremely small, slowing down the learning process. Techniques like careful \n",
    "weight initialization and regularization are often employed to mitigate this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the tanh function offers a broader output range, stronger non-linearity, and zero-centered outputs compared to the sigmoid \n",
    "function. Its suitability depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the requirements of the neural network task."
